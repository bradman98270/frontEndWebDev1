# Front End Web Development 1 at SDCE
=====================================

## Class notes:
### HMTL cheet sheet:
* http://web.stanford.edu/group/csp/cs21/htmlcheatsheet.pdf
* http://livetools.uiparade.com/form-builder.html

_strong tag vs em tag --> urgent vs important_

The directories are numbered according to day of attendance from the first day of class. Within each numbered directory are a historical archive of notes taken during each lecture. I did git "commits" and "push" everytime there was an important change the teacher was trying to convey within the teacher's lecture or instruction.

## What to learn first:
1. [learn "markdown" in 10 minutes](http://markdowntutorial.com/)
2. [learn "github" in 15 minutes](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

## A couple tools I use to help me develop faster:
* [develop anywhere with "Cloud 9"](https://c9.io/login)
* [use "github" for small teams](https://github.com/jun3rd)
* [ALSO use "bitbucket" for large teams](https://bitbucket.org/Jun3rd/)
* [pick a linux environment, considering apache is the #1 used web server](http://distrowatch.com/)
* [learn the "back-end" by configuring your own "LAMP" stack (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) ](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu)
* what do I edit/develop with locally on my machine? [I use Geany](http://www.geany.org/) because it's a customizable editor and extremely light IDE (Integrated Eevelopment Environment)
* [color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) - contributed by [Jazz Aguon](https://github.com/jazzums)

## Understanding SEO:
* [Methods for comparing rankings of search engine results](http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs315/Papers/BarIlan-MathodsComparingRankings.pdf)
