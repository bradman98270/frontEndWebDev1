            Here they come! They're coming in too fast! Oooh! We've lost lateral controls. Don't worry, she'll hold together. You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don't get cocky. There are still two more of them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault.

            Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification. These are not the droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. You can go about your business. Move along. Move along. Move along.

            What's wrong? Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo? Okay, easy she goes! Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you.

The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. But he can...

            What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
