# Notes ( Lecture 3 . part . sub-section )
=======
##(3.1.1)
**_Information Architecture: art+science to organize+label: websites, intranets, online communities and software to support: usability+findability ... ref: iainstitute.org_**

### goals {users focus on tasks in the normal way they think about it [expect it to be shown] <<== NOT wasting their time finding their way around}
* (navigation feels natural) + (blends into background)
* content is logically grouped
* searching, sorting and filtering is second nature

--------------
##(3.1.2)
1. user research task (via card sorting) --->> find out how they categorize information
2. create solution aka IA (using categorized information) --->> usability testing (via reverse card sort) --->> make sure it fits user needs (LIVE tests)

NOTE: use above two steps to _guide_ creativity to keep on track (via weekly user input+"sign-off")
--------------
#(3.2.1)

**You are _NOT_ your users**
_Note: IA data can be re-purposed for other uses in the future!_

### focus on:
* how users think
* categorize: --->> later used for menus [and secondary navigation, content differntiation of different news topics, help users find search results, starting point for data drill down in filters]
	* activities
	* items
	* individuals

--------------
##(3.2.2)

1. participants sort cards (that have 1 task people perform on the site) into groups [while developer watches and listens]
2. participants read each card 1-by-1 placing each into groups of similar tasks
3. ask participants to find groups that contain more than 10 cards into smaller groups
4. participants write a name for each group on a black index card --->> probe for areas that seem to cause problems in order to understand the reason why participants placed the cards into the groups they did
5. ( compare the groups they made <<--vs-->> language they used to compare the groups ) --->> to discover categories about how users think about the information  [the categories become the IA]

--------------
##(3.3.1)

####focus on key tasks:
* activities users want to do (perform)
* information users want to find
* help users need
* list of products users will search for
* list of services that benefit users

**_identify items that exists at similar levels_**
Baseline: narrow to 30-100 items <<--- from 200 item starting list

_list tasks currently supported, but --->> be careful offering what people do NOT want and/or missing to offer what people need_
####if new site:
* list wants (using examples from current seller spaces)
* list actions people can perform (tasks) --->> ref: Foundations of UX: Content Strategy with Patrick Nichols
	* focus on content audits+/gaps

higher level sorts --->> individual sorts {@each section}  <<--- perfect for multiple user types using different parts of the site

--------------
##(3.3.2)

####for digital sorting (via a website survey, ie. optimalworkshop.com), know:
* why perform reverse sort?
* how long it will take?
* what sample customer gets for doing the sort?
* when you want them to do it by?
* who to contact with questions?
* copy URL to card sort page online

**_take note of short sort times or small categories --->> help those users to receive better sorts_**


--------------
##(3.3.3)
###making the cards:
* drawbacks: long duration exercise, horrible penmanship 
* number each card with a reference # (from 1-total)

--------------
##(3.3.4)

###**_find users that will use the product_**
* find enough people (15 in each use category)
* check they fit recruiting profile
* schedule times to meet
* reward with gratuity

###**_paper based card sort is easy to setup_**
* large table
* area free of distractions
* test indoors

--------------
##(3.3.5)
###guidelines:
* sit and watch each participant (for the 1st few, before conducting group participant sorts)
* create moderator script to be consistent with participants
* get them to think out loud (generates wealth of additional information {context})
* when participants have doubts, their vocabulary used or comments --->> provides a thought process solutions for feasable alternative arrangements
* when their VERY sure about an item --->> a level of confidense of its placement is solidified

**_have participants write down what each grouped card [category] should be called/labelled-**

###questions to ask participants:
* what is the overall pattern here?
* were any groups difficult to create? if so, why?
* were any cards difficult to place into a group? if so, why?

###do _NOT_ ask leading questions. ask neutral questions:
* tell me more about this grouping?
* explain what you mean by this category name?

###last step:
* thank participant
* give gratuity
* answer any questions they may have
* after participant leaves, record number & order of each card in each group (under category name)
