# Lecture 4:
=============

## (4.1.1)
* NOT prototypes:
	* sketches == explore ideas quickly
	* wireframes == map out application structure
	* mockups == refined representation of final

* prototypes:
	* simulations/models of some part of how the app works:
		* how the finished product will work
		* app flow
		* interaction
		* usability
		* feasability
		* fidelity range:
			* paper sketch -->> fully realized designs
			* simulate entire app or single use interaction

## (4.1.2)
* prototype IF UX is important
	* good planning -->> user test -->> redesign
	* 
	* 

## (4.1.3)
** fidelity = how _"closely"_ it resembles look and functionality of finished project **
### prototype goals:
* physically refine design
	* physically test design
	* test ideas, gauge user feed back, try ideas w/o committing code
	* higher fidelity prototypes provide feedback on design usability
	* lower fidelity prototypes provides room for innovation
* design w/o technical restraints
	* focus on UX w/o worrying about technical feasibility
	* dev restrictions harm UX and narrow focus
	* functional prototype justifies further development of features
* increased collaboration
	* spur collaboration more than any other phase of design
	* establish rules and channels for communication
	* have plan in place to keep discussions productive
* sell ideas
	* easier to convince clients if they can play with it
	* functionality focuses on (exciting) selling points of the product

## (4.1.4)
### build effective prototypes
* know whom you're designing for
* build ONLY what you need
* do NOT waste time on details
* accurately depict UX
* properly set expectation(s) of user goal


## (4.2.1)
### design process overview
* typical design process:
	* brainstorming (set time limit): {goal is to generate as many ideas as you can within limited time frame}
		* pencil & paper sketch
		* collaboration planning
		* word storms
		* style/element tiles	
	* planning = basic documentation, outline, wireframe
	* experiment with prototype
	* test and evaluate prototype
	* refine (evaluate == suggest changes to) design (
