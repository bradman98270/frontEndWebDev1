# Lecture 4:
=============

## (4.1.1)
* NOT prototypes:
	* sketches == explore ideas quickly
	* wireframes == map out application structure
	* mockups == refined representation of final

* prototypes:
	* simulations/models of some part of how the app works:
		* how the finished product will work
		* app flow
		* interaction
		* usability
		* feasability
		* fidelity range:
			* paper sketch -->> fully realized designs
			* simulate entire app or single use interaction

## (4.1.2)
* prototype IF UX is important
	* good planning -->> user test -->> redesign
	* 
	* 

## (4.1.3)
** fidelity = how _"closely"_ it resembles look and functionality of finished project **
### prototype goals:
* physically refine design
	* physically test design
	* test ideas, gauge user feed back, try ideas w/o committing code
	* higher fidelity prototypes provide feedback on design usability
	* lower fidelity prototypes provides room for innovation
* design w/o technical restraints
	* focus on UX w/o worrying about technical feasibility
	* dev restrictions harm UX and narrow focus
	* functional prototype justifies further development of features
* increased collaboration
	* spur collaboration more than any other phase of design
	* establish rules and channels for communication
	* have plan in place to keep discussions productive
* sell ideas
	* easier to convince clients if they can play with it
	* functionality focuses on (exciting) selling points of the product

## (4.1.4)
### build effective prototypes
* know whom you're designing for
* build ONLY what you need
* do NOT waste time on details
* accurately depict UX
* properly set expectation(s) of user goal


## (4.2.1)
### design process overview
* typical design process:
	* brainstorming (set time limit): {goal is to generate as many ideas as you can within limited time frame}
		* pencil & paper sketch
		* collaboration planning
		* word storms
		* style/element tiles	
	* planning = basic documentation, outline, wireframe
	* experiment with prototype
	* test and evaluate prototype
	* refine (evaluate == suggest changes to) design ( 

## (4.2.2)
### scoping  = define overall focus and set measurable goal(s)
* follow current existing process, but if none exists create one based on current workflow
* refer to initial documents that define project requirements (which contains: scope, intended audience, basic framework of how it should function)
* example requirements document: contain sections:
	* Executive summary:
		* establish focus of application
		* outline basic functionality
		* overall direction of development process
	* target audience: 
	* functional requirements:
		* "user account" functionality
			* user login
			* creating new users
			* main purpose achieved via user interaction: (ie. planning a meal)
			* additional enhancements (ie. meal suggestions, saved meals, choosing meal compliments, ...)
			* miscellaneous functionality (ie. general AND specialized user interface(s))
	* flatform requirements: hardware, OS, app dependencies (etc....)
	* application qualities:
		* user-friendliness
		* correctness
		* re-usability
		* extensibility
		* verifiability
		* understandability
		* interoperability
	* time schedule
	* potential risks
		* difficult to use areas:
		* incorrect information
		* complex algorithms used (ie. list assumptions that the meal planning algorithm is expected to achieve)
	* future changes
		* web interface
		* advertising products
		* 3rd party tie-ins
**_NOTE: ALL projects deviate (somewhat) from the initial requirements document_**
#### properly scoping projects:
* determine the focus of your project, and the basic idea of its requirements
* be generative: allow prototyping process to refine this focus will be more innovative and generate new ideas
* often results in a better overall UX
* example: (meal planning app)
	* tablet app assists with planning meal
	* meal suggestions are made based on what user is cooking for their entree choice
	* user can save meals and recipes
	* over time, app should learn user's personal preferences (and make suggestions of "perfectly matching" meals)

## (4.2.3)
### sketching ideas
* allows everyone to contribute/participate (10-15 minutes w/ review)
* collaborate with others to discover what's important to other stakeholders
* UX "usability" concerns addressed early in the planning phase
* USE project board or wall to POST ALL ideas, then narrow by rejecting worse ideas
* include sketching session into prototype review

## (4.2.4)
### understanding prototype fidelity
* fidelity prototype == how closely visual design matches finished product ==>> visual fidelity
* low-fidelity = wireframes or "schematic prototypes" -->> focusing on (static) content or _how_ the interface works
* high-fidelity = refined design prototype -->> focused on how (dynamic {variable sourced}) apps react to user interaction
* fidelity considerations:
	* visual design
	* interactivity
		* UI widgets react to gestures/interactions
		* elements animate/transition
		* screen states changes based on user interactions
	* data and content
	* environment (where will users be accessing this data?)
	* social interaction (how will ALL the users experience the content)
	* ... other aspects of user interaction
* finished design concerns:
	* colour
	* layout
	* typography
	* all other visual components

** consider a sliding indicator to allow stakeholders to estimate fidelity: **
* visual design (low <<---- vs ---->> high)
* interactivity (low <<---- vs ---->> high)
* data and content (low <<---- vs ---->> high)
* environment (low <<---- vs ---->> high)
* social interaction (low <<---- vs ---->> high)
* other aspects (low <<---- vs ---->> high)
