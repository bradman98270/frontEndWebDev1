<h3>What preparation do I need to carry out for my spray tan?</h3>
<p>You should exfoliate well 24-48 hours before your tan in order to remove any dead skin cells (this will help prolong your tan). If you shave or wax, this should also be done before the day of your tan. Do not wear deodorants or make up or any other preparation on your skin on tanning day as these can act as a barrier to the tanning solution.</p>

<h3>How does spray tanning work?</h3>
<p>Your body is sprayed with a solution that contains a certain percentage of DHA (DiHydroxyAcetone), a colorless sugar that reacts with the Amino acids in the dead layers of your skin and over a period of a few hours goes brown.</p>

<h3>Is spray tanning safe?</h3>
<p>Yes! DHA has been approved for cosmetic use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Canadian Health Ministry and most of the EU member nations. It is considered nontoxic and noncarcinogenic. DHA based Sunless tanning has been recommended by the Skin Cancer Organization, American Academy of Dermatology, Canadian Dermatology Association, The American Cancer Society and the American Medical Association.</p>

<h3>How long does a spray tan last?</h3>
<p>Your body constantly 'sloughs off' dead skin cells. This is why natural sun tans fade over a few days. Spray tanning only affects the outer skin layer, so again, as your skin cells are naturally shed, the spray tan will fade. Your tan should last 5-10 days, typically 7 days, but longer if you look after your skin by moisturizing every day. However, everyone is different.</p>

<h3>I am diabetic, is spray tanning OK for me?</h3>
<p>DHA is a chemical derived from glycerin and was first used in the treatment of diabetes, as some diabetics are better able to tolerate DHA than glucose in their treatment! We recommend that you consult a physician prior to spray tanning.</p>

<h3>Can pregnant women spray tan?</h3>
<p>While there is no medical evidence saying that spray tanning can affect pregnant women, we recommend that anyone with this question consult a physician.</p>

<h3>Will I look orange or streaky with a spray tan?</h3>
<p>No, absolutely not! The orange color is the result of tanning pills, and older tanning agents. A professional spray tan with modern tanning agents avoids this, and streakiness is caused by improper application of home tanning creams and sprays - which is why you should always let a professional apply your tan.</p>

<h3>Will the solution stain my clothes/bed sheets?</h3>
<p>No, all that is rubbing off onto your clothes and/or sheets is the cosmetic bronzer that is found in the sunless tanning solution.</p>

<h3>I usually break out in freckles when I try to tan. Will the tanning solution make my freckles come out too?</h3>
<p>There is nothing in the tanning solution that will cause more freckles to break out. In fact, in most cases, freckles and blemishes will become less pronounced because the lighter skin areas will darken and reduce the color differentiation between the blemishes and the rest of your skin. However if you have skin damage, you may noticed those areas could appear darker after your tanning session, due to the texture of those areas being rough.</p>

<h3>How long should I wait prior to showering?</h3>
<p>We recommend waiting 8-12 hours prior to showering and/or sweating. Any type of moisture or water could affect the results of the tan. Be sure to avoid sweating, rain and any source of water from hitting the skin if possible. Also avoid wearing clothes that rub against the skin as this could also affect the results of the tan.</p>

<h3>* When showering, you may notice color washing off your skin. Rest assured, this is just cosmetic bronzer, not your tan! After showering, the skin will continue to develop tan color for up to 24 hours!</h3>
