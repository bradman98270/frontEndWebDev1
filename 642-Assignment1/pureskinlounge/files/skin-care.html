<p>cancellation policy</p>

<p>Please understand that when you forget or cancel your appointment without giving enough notice, we miss the opportunity to fill that appointment time, and clients on our waiting list miss the opportunity to receive services.  Our appointments are confirmed by text or email 72 hours in advance because we know how easy it is to forget an appointment you booked a month ago. You will also receive a reminder 24 hours in advance.  If you need to make any changes to your appointment that is time to do so. Since this time has been reserved especially for you, a cancellation fee of $25 will apply if you fail to give a 24 hour notice.</p>
