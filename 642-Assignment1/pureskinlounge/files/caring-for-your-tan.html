	<h2>caring for your tan</h2>
	<p>MON - SAT  9am to 8pm<br />
	BY APPOINTMENT ONLY</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Apply moisturizer, morning and evening, after your post-tanning shower. Hydrated skin makes your tan last longer and your skin looking healthy. Consider the entire Body Bronze Sunless Skin Care System to maximize the benefits of your tanning session. For example, M.D. BRONZE ™ & M.D GLOW ™ is a soothing moisturizing system that provides light self-tanning action so that you can extend your results days longer than usual:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Evens out and maintains the color of any tan.</li>
		<li>Moisturizes and promotes soft, supple skin.</li>
		<li>Prolongs tanning results.</li>
		<li>Keeps your skin looking toned and healthy.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>for best results:</h3>
	<p>Wait at least 7-10 days before your next application. Make sure skin is exfoliated and free from old tan before reapplying. This will ensure smooth, even, sunless tanning results every time.<p>
	
	<h3>What can affect a spray tan?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Anti-aging, smoothing, or skin renewal products can increase fading and can cause blotchiness.</li>
		<li>Alpha Hydroxy Acids can speed exfoliation and skin turnover.</li>
		<li>Beta Hydroxy Acids can increase fading and can lighten a tan.</li>
		<li>Retin-A type products can increase fading and can cause blotchiness.</li>
		<li>Toners containing high amounts of alcohol or witch hazel can fade a tan (witch hazel extract is fine).</li>
		<li>Anti-acne products can cause faster fading, peeling, and blotchiness.</li>
		<li>odermabrasion treatments.</li>
		<li>Any medication that affects the skin or skin health.</li>
		<li>Antibiotics and chemotherapy drugs.</li>
		<li>Make-up remover cleaning preparations or oils can fade a tan.</li>
		<li>Bar soaps, even moisturizing ones can be very harsh on the skin and a sunless tan.  Deodorant soaps should be avoided.  Use a SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate)-free body wash for a longer lasting tan.</li>
		<li>Some brands of lotions can cause rapid or poor fading.</li>
		<li>Do not use a rough wash implement for daily washing (loofahs, scrub mitts or scrub gloves, etc.)  Gently use a soft washcloth or your hand.</li>
		<li>Adhesive tape, or products applied to skin, can pull the “tan” off (surgical tape, bandage, or peel off facial strips).</li>
		<li>Hair removal procedures and depilatory products will lighten tanned skin.  Waxing will also fade or remove a tan.</li>
		<li>Shaving exfoliates the skin so have clients use a sharp razor with a lubricating product.  Dull shaving can increase fading or cause stripes.</li>
		<li>Body hair bleach products will also bleach the underlying skin.</li>
		<li>Submersion in hot tubs, long hot baths, swimming pools (chlorine), fresh or salt water (a waterproof sun block helps) can lighten a tan.</li>
		<li>Reapply a lotion after swimming and always pat dry after bathing or swimming; do not rub.</li>
		<li>Women may “tan” differently during various hormonal changes (menstruation, ovulation, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or even heightened stress).</li>
		<li>Oily skin types (face, chest, neck, and upper back) tan lighter than surrounding skin.</li>
		<li>Insect repellent sprays and some perfumes, when sprayed directly onto the skin, remove or fade a tan.  Instead spray a cloud into air, and walk through the mist.</li>
		<li>Excessive sweating and rubbing can cause tan to fade faster.</li>
	</ul>
