	<ul>
		<li>Taking ibuprofen at least 20 minutes beforehand may help dull your pain receptors (as long as it’s not contraindicated by your doctor).</li>
		<li>The day of your waxing, limit your caffeine intake as it can stimulate the nervous system which can make you more sensitive and red.</li>
		<li>For females, try to schedule your appointment within the first 2 weeks after you have ended your cycle as this is when you are probably retaining the least amount of fluid, and should probably be the least sensitive. We will still wax our clients if they are on their cycle as long as they wear a tampon and know they will most likely be more sensitive.</li>
		<li>For body waxing treatments, please allow about 2 weeks of growth before your visit. Everyone’s hair grows at a different pace, but 2 weeks is a good rule-of-thumb. The longer the growth (within reason) will mean less tweezing and a cleaner wax. Your hair must be at least half the length of your pinky nail (go ahead… check your pinky!)</li>
		<li>If you do not wax or shave your hair at all, please do not trim.</li>
		<li>Do not apply self tanner, moisturizer, or any abrasive body or facial scrubs.</li>
		<li>Do not go sit in the sun or go to the tanning booth prior to your service.</li>
		<li>Discontinuing any product that exfoliates or dries the skin for at least 1 week prevents tears, scabbing or burning.</li>
		<li>Avoid getting spray tanned before any waxing procedure. Wax tends to lift the color off your skin leaving it patchy-looking.</li>
		<li>Some products that conflict with waxing are:
			<ul>
				<li>Accutane, Differin, Retin A/Retinol, Glycolic acid/AHA’s, ProActive, Avita, Benzoyl peroxide, Salicylic acid/ BHA’s
					<ul>
						<li>These are only some of the products that we are aware of that may cause problems. New ones come out every day! If you have any doubt, don’t use it or don’t wax. However, if you still desire to use your skin products that are not conducive to waxing, we may use an extremely hypoallergenic hard wax that is great for sensitive and chemically treated skin. When you call for your appointment, please let us know</li>

	<h3>[P O S T  W A X   C A R E]</h3>
	<h4>To ensure maximum comfort and benefit after the treatment, it is important to follow the steps below at home:</h4>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Avoid applying heat to the waxed area for 12 to 24 hours. This includes hot baths, sauna, and steam.</li>
	<li>Use an anti-acne lotion for face, back and chest following the treatment and twice a day until breakouts are gone. Use only an anti-acne product recommended by your skin care professional.</li>
	<li>Avoid suntanning for 12 to 24 hours. This includes any strong ultraviolet (UV) light exposure or tanning bed treatments.</li>
	<li>Avoid applying highly fragranced products to the waxed area. This includes, perfume, scented body lotions, anti-perspirants, cosmetics, or feminine hygiene sprays. Only use professional products, recommended to you by the skin care therapist who performed the waxing service.</li>
	<li>Avoid using harsh abrasives or exfoliants on the waxed area. However if you are prone to in-grown hairs, the day after your waxing treatment, exfoliate newly waxed area with a loofah to avoid future problems.</li>
	<li>Avoid applying high SPF sunblocks to the waxed area for 12-24 hours after the waxing service. Sunscreen chemicals can be irritating to the newly waxed skin. This includes self-tanning products and tan accelerators.</li>
	<li>Any pinking of the skin should disappear within 6 to 8 hours after the waxing treatment. Slight pinking is normal, and indicates that the hair was removed from the root, rather than superficially broken off, as in shaving. This is the reason that professional waxing lasts so much longer.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>For best results, repeat your professional waxing every 4 to 6 weeks depending on the area and your individual hair growth rate. Regular exfoliation may be helpful to remove dead skin so your hairs can get out above the surface of the pores and not become ingrown. Routine waxing helps the skin getaccustomed to the procedure and may minimize irritation.</h4>
