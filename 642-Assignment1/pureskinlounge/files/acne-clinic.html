	<p>Acne is a skin disorder that can be controlled with the right combination of products, used in the correct way. Our Acne Clinic has a proven system that will have your acne under control in about three to four months, depending on your type of acne. We combine the power of clinical-grade products that are customized for you, with a series of bi-monthly services. We also teach you about other aggravating factors that make you break out – foods, medications, cosmetics, stress, and common ingredients in skin care that may be clogging your pores (even professional and prescription products).</p>

	<h3>there is no one-size-fits-all solution for clearing acne.</h3>
	<p>Skin care products alone are not enough; you need to know what products you need based on your skin and acne type, and the products need to be adjusted based on your skin's response to them. Dermatologists give you prescription medications or products, but they are not with you every step of the way to monitor your progress.</p>

	<h3>at Pure Skin Lounge we offer:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Your Personal Skin Coach. You don't have to deal with your acne by yourself. Your treatment at the Acne Clinic will be guided by an acne expert. Through the process, you will be educated on your acne type, actively monitor your progress and adjust your product and treatment regime based on your skins response.</li>
		<li>Customized Acne Treatments. Your acne treatments will be customized for you every visit. The types of treatments you may receive include: deep pore cleansing acne facials, extractions, chemical peels and hydrating enzyme masks.</li>
		<li>Professional Strength Skin Care. Along with your treatments, you will be recommended a skin care regime based on your specific acne and skin type.</li>
		<li>A Clear Skin Diet Plan. Your diet affects your skin. We will educate you on what foods may be aggravating your acne and devise a clear skin diet to help stop your acne from the inside out.</li>
		<li>On-Call Support. We care about each and every client and are always available to answer your questions. You can email us anytime at pureskinlounge@gmail.com and receive a response from us by phone or email within 24 hours.</li>

<h3>o u r   g u a r a n t e e</h3>
<p>Clearing acne takes time, dedication and commitment. As part of the process you will need to commit to following a diligent skin care regime, bi-weekly professional treatments and abiding by a clear skin diet. If you follow though on this commitment, we guarantee that you will see visible improvements in your skin within 2-6 months.</p>
