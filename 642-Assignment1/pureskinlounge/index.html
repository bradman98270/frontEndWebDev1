	<hr />
	<p>Pure Skin Lounge implements an arsenal of proprietary treatments and clinically active ingredients to transform your skin. Clearly committed to beautiful skin, we aspire to help you achieve luminous skin.   Each Pure Skin Lounge treatment begins with a skin analysis and consultation to help choose the right treatment for you.  From fine lines, wrinkles, and skin laxity, blackheads, oily skin, dry flaky skin, rosacea, and age spots to Melasma - we can tighten, lighten, reduce redness and improve your skins texture, while correcting the acid mantle.</p>
	<p>As a certified Acne Specialist facility, we've helped countless clients achieve their clear skin goals.  We can get your skin under control in as little as 6 to 12 weeks, depending on the type of acne you have. Our acne program is tried and true, having a 95% success rate!  You no longer have to suffer from this disease on your own, we are with you every step of the way.</p>
	<p>Pure Skin Lounge utilizes a variety of waxes for hair removal.  We carry hard waxes, various soft waxes, and rollers.  We are not made equal - so we have an assortment of depilation techniques to accommodate everyone.</p>
	<p>Our hard wax is custom made with natural humectants, resulting in a less painful intimate wax [Brazilian, Man'Zilian] leaving your skin feeling soft and supple. We have extensive training in authentic Brazilian Wax and our technique will change the way you think of this intimate service.  It doesn't have to be excruciating, and your hair will never get broken - resulting in quick regrowth.  We also take pride in complete hair removal - meaning, no hair left behind!  Every client gets their own pot of wax at every appointment, and although that may be - we still never double dip!  Ever.</p>
	<p>Shaping brows is an art that we are masters at.  And 'Brow Rehab' is a popular service at Pure Skin Lounge. During rehab, we go over in detail a personalized plan to regrow and reshape your brows.  We are meticulous and take our time for every brow wax whether it's your first appointment or your fiftieth.  All brow appointments include a brow massage, trim, wax, moisturizer and finished with a soothing antioxidant mist.</p>
	<p>Cleanliness is very important to us so we go above and beyond to ensure a sterile environment.  Pure Skin Lounge maintains the highest level of sanitation at all times, for every client. Your comfort and safety is our priority!</p>
