	<h2>waxing FAQs</h2>
	<p>MON - SAT  9am to 8pm<br />
	BY APPOINTMENT ONLY</p>
	<hr />
	<h3>How should I take care of my skin after the treatment?</h3>
	<p>For body areas, exfoliate the day after your hair removal treatment, and twice weekly thereafter, to help prevent ingrown hairs (which are especially able to occur in the bikini area)  We also carry Bikini Kitty exfoliating system for those susceptible to ingrown hairs.</p>
	
	<h3>What would prevent me from waxing?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Clients who are taking Accutane, using Retin A. or are on any antibiotics or medication that contribute to increased skin sensitivity and thinning of blood.</li>
		<li>Have just tanned in the sun or tanning bed</li> 
		<li>Some physicians do not recommend hair waxing for persons suffering from diabetes or who have varicose veins or poor circulation, as they are more susceptible to infection.</li>
		<li>Areas of skin affected by warts, pimples, moles or rashes or on skin that is irritated, chapped or suffering from sunburn.</li>
		<li>Never on peeling, broken skin or varicose veins.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>*When in doubt, consult with your doctor prior to any waxing service.</p>
	
	<h3>How long do I have to wait before my first wax?</h3>
	<p>To get the best waxing results, we need your hair to be at least one-fourth of an inch long. This is an average of 2 weeks of growth. Yes, it seems like a long time to grow, but it’s worth the waxing results!</p>
	
	<h3>I got my eyebrows waxed once and some skin came off, why is that?</h3>
	<p>There can be several reasons for this. If you are using skin care products that contain salicylic acid, glycolic acid or alpha hydroxyl acid (AHA) of any kind, these can cause the skin to lift while waxing. Another cause is aggressive exfoliation such as microdermabrasion or chemical peels. Prescription medication such as antibiotics, accutane, retin-a, renova, strivectin, proactive and avage can cause thinning of the skin which results in lifting during waxing. My recommendation is that if you are unsure about what you are using, just ask. But it is still difficult to predict how every skin type will react no matter how many precautions are taken.</p>
	
	<h3>What is the difference between getting waxed here or just going to a nail salon?</h3>
	<p>There are MANY reasons that a person should avoid getting waxed at a nail salon, but simply ask yourself a few questions about your waxing experience there: Did they ask you to fill out any information about your skin or any products you are using that might contraindicate waxing procedures?  Do they double dip their sticks into a wax pot (if they use a wax pot)?  Do you know that “waxing” falls under SKIN CARE and not NAIL CARE? It may be quicker or cheaper, but keep in mind: your skin and your health are with you for the rest of your life. Treat it with the utmost respect and safety.</p>
	
	<h3>Why come to Pure Skin Lounge vs. other salons?</h3>
	<p>Skin is most important aspect of the body. You and your skin are best friends for life so why not treat it right?  We are licensed professionals that have studied skincare and hair removal with over 10 years of experience! We use top-grade hypoallergenic waxes designed for sensitive skin and we use extremely sanitary protocols for every service.</p>
	
	<h3>Should I tweeze or shave in between waxes?</h3>
	<p>If your waxing appointments do not coordinate with your monthly schedule, tweezing is a quick fix. We strongly advise our clients not to shave in between visits because shaving disrupts the hair growth and will make your next wax more uncomfortable. But let’s stay away from the razor!</p>
	
	<h3>What should I do in between appointments?</h3>
	<p>Exfoliate! Exfoliate! Exfoliate! To ensure your next wax is smoother and prevent ingrown hairs, we suggest exfoliating. By doing this, dead skin and oils are removed from the surface of the skin so the hair is able to grow back evenly with minimal irritation.</p>
	
	<h3>Do a lot of males come in for waxing?</h3>
	<p>Yes. About 40% of our clientele are men. We offer brow and body waxing for male clients.</p>
	
	<h3>Do a lot of people get Brazilians?</h3>
	<p>Yes! Here at Pure Skin Lounge, Brazilians are the most popular waxing service. Our estheticians are professionally trained and specialize in waxing the bikini area.</p>
	
	<h3>“I’m not exactly sure what service I am looking to have done…”</h3>
	<p>If you are unsure of what service you would like to have done, feel free to discuss it with your esthetician so we can book the proper amount of time for the appointment. If you can grow it, we can wax it!</p>
	
	<h3>“I’m worried about the pain, what can I do to reduce it?”</h3>
	<p>Taking anti-inflammatory medications such as Advil or Tylenol approximately 45 minutes prior to your appointment will help ease the discomfort. But don’t be alarmed, the wax we use is a hypoallergenic wax created for sensitive skin. We promise you will be just fine, you’re getting waxed by the best. Clients most common comment after waxing is “OH WOW THAT WASN’T BAD AT ALL!”</p>
	
	<h3>Can you wax ‘mature’ skin?</h3>
	<p>Yes. However, we are unable to wax if clients are on certain medications or anti-wrinkle/anti-aging creams. These creams contain ingredients that make your skin “lift” which almost looks like a little burn mark. Ingredients in these products are retinol, alpha hydroxyl acids, tretinoin, bleaching agents like hydroquinone.</p>
	
	<h3>Can I wax on my period?</h3>
	<p>Yes! We just suggest clients wear a tampon during the service. You may be a little more sensitive, but if you’re worried about what we will think- don’t worry, if you don’t care, we don’t care!</p>
	
	<h3>Should I trim my hair before coming in?</h3>
	<p>It is best to leave the hair as long as possible before waxing. The longer the hair, the easier it will be for the wax to grab on to it. Sometimes trimming causes the hair to be too short, leave it to us!</p>
	
	<h3>How long will it take for my hair to grow back?</h3>
	<p>Clients typically schedule appointments on a 3-4 week basis for all body waxing services. All hair types are different, but as you wax, each time your hair tends to get thinner, lighter and much more soft.</p>
	
	<h3>How long does the hair have to be in order to wax?</h3>
	<p>Hair should be about ¼ inch long for all bikini and body services. A good way to test this is to see if your hair covers at least half of your pinky fingernail.</p>
	
	<h3>Is there anything I should do to prepare for waxing and to be comfortable?</h3>
	<p>Yes! There are a few options. We always recommend ibuprofen at least 20 minutes before your waxing service, as long as this does not contradict what your doctor has told you. If you are a female client, schedule your waxing service the first 2 weeks after your cycle. Your sensitivity level is a lot less during this time. Avoid caffeine and alcohol as these can stimulate, making you more sensitive and increase redness after waxing. Pregnancy also increases sensitivity.</p>
	
	<h3>How long will my skin stay red?</h3>
	<p>It depends on the person and the skin type. For most people the redness is mostly gone after 30 minutes to an hour. Avoid perfumes, scrubs and other irritants the day of your service. For brides or if you are going to a special occasion, I recommend waxing a month before to see how your skin reacts. If everything is fine, schedule another wax a day or two before your event.</p>
